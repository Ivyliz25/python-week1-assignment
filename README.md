# 🧮 My First Python Calculator 🎉

Welcome to my very first calculator project in Python! 😄

This beginner-friendly calculator takes **two numbers** as input and performs a variety of basic arithmetic operations — it's simple, but powerful!

## 🚀 Features

Here's what this calculator can do:

- ➕ **Addition**
- ➖ **Subtraction**
- ✖️ **Multiplication**
- ➗ **Division**
- 🔢 **Floor Division**
- 🌀 **Modulo (Remainder)**
- 🔋 **Exponentiation (Power)**

## 🧾 How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer (version 3+).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the Python file.
3. Run the script with:

   ```bash
   python mycalculator.py
   ```

4. Enter two numbers when prompted.
5. View the results of **all** supported operations printed out neatly.

## 📦 Sample Output

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3
Results of the two numbers
Sum: 13.0
difference: 7.0
quotient: 3.3333333333333335
multiplication: 30.0
floor: 3.0
remainder: 1.0
power: 1000.0
```

## 🤓 Why This Matters

This was my first attempt at writing a functional calculator using Python! It helped me practice:
- Taking user input
- Performing multiple arithmetic operations
- Printing formatted results
- Gaining confidence with Python syntax and flow
